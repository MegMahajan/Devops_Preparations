Docker's architecture is based on a client-server model, consisting of several key components that work together to create, run, and manage containers. Here's a short explanation:

1. Docker Client:
Docker CLI (Command Line Interface): The Docker client is a command-line tool that allows users to interact with the Docker daemon. Commands like docker build, docker run, and docker pull are issued through the Docker CLI.
2. Docker Daemon (Docker Engine):
Docker Daemon: The core service running on the host machine, responsible for managing Docker objects (containers, images, networks, and volumes). The daemon listens for API requests from the Docker client and performs the requested actions.
REST API: The Docker daemon exposes a REST API that allows communication between the Docker client and other Docker components.
3. Docker Objects:
Images: Immutable templates that contain the application and its dependencies. Images are used to create containers.
Containers: Running instances of Docker images. Containers are isolated environments where applications run.
Volumes: Persistent storage that can be shared between containers and with the host system.
Networks: Configurations that manage the communication between containers and other systems.
4. Docker Registry:
Docker Hub: The default public registry where Docker images are stored and distributed. Docker registries can also be private.
Image Storage: The registry stores Docker images, which can be pulled by the Docker daemon to create containers.
5. Docker Architecture Summary:
Client-Server Model: The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon using the REST API. The daemon handles container management, using images stored in a registry.
Modularity: Dockerâ€™s architecture is modular, allowing components like containers, images, volumes, and networks to be managed independently.
Isolation: Containers run in isolated environments, ensuring that applications are portable and can run consistently across different environments.
This architecture enables Docker to efficiently create, deploy, and manage containers, making application development and deployment more agile and scalable.
