Docker's architecture follows a client-server model:

Docker Client: The command-line tool used to interact with Docker.

Docker Daemon (Engine): The core service that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes.

REST API: Facilitates communication between the Docker client and daemon.

Docker Objects: Includes images (templates), containers (runtime environments), volumes (persistent storage), and networks (communication between containers).

Docker Registry: Stores Docker images, with Docker Hub being the default public registry.

This architecture allows Docker to efficiently manage containerized applications, ensuring portability, isolation, and scalability.
