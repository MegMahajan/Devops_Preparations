In my role, I work in an Agile environment, managing tasks through Jira. My daily activities include creating, supporting, and maintaining CI/CD pipelines. Sometimes, I create CI/CD projects from scratch, while other times, I modify existing pipelines to meet new requirements. I also handle or refactor kubernetes yaml, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and Ansible, ensuring consistency across environments. Additionally, I manage Git conflicts, troubleshoot issues of k8s, support the development team, explore new technologies, conduct POCs, document findings, and mentor new team members, including those new to CI/CD or freshers, while preparing reports on CI/CD adoption for higher management.
